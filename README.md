# Axios/Mocha/Node.js API testing framework

This is a basic backend testing framework. It consists of the following:
1. A set of API tests for a programmable endpoint made in Axios, Mocha and Node.js
2. Several helper function examples for creating placeholder entries and performing cleanup
3. Variable file example which can contain reusable variables such as API endpoint. APi URL value currently empty on public repo

The framework has some basic OOP principles implemented for scalability and modularity. Further OOP can be developed here.
